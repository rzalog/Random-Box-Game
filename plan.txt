Let's make a simple game!

How it works (the basics):
	- there is a box randomly moving around
		* pops up in random places
	- user has to click on it before it moves again
	- if user manages to do this, the rate at which the box disappears and reappears increases, thus making the game more challenging

Other things to think of:
	- time limit to click on the box
		* this is how you make the game fun!
		* TOTAL time limit
			- ex. 1 minute, constantly counting down
			- game is keeping track of the score the whole time
	- give user a difficulty rating each round
		* only increase the difficulty every x number of rounds?
	- Multiple boxes that appear, have to click all of them to finish a round

Todo list:
	- get a box to randomly move around the screen on a certain time interval
		* randomly select a top left coordinate that is within the board
		* draw a rectangle there

		*** PROBLEM ***
		How do we get the other rectangles to disappear?

		* add a time interval, then keep drawing stuff
		
	- get it so that when we click that box, something will happen
